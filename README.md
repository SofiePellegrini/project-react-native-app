# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

Week 16 project at the Technigo Bootcamp. We were supposed to build our first mobile app with React Native. We were supposed to work with either React Navigation, fetching from an external API or using one of the sensors (camera, accelerometer etc) or use several of them.
